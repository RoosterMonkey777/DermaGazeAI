## Overview

**DermaGazeAI** is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize skin health management. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, cloud computing, and an intuitive mobile interface, the app empowers users with tools for skin condition diagnosis, medication management, and personalized skincare recommendations. 

The app was developed as a capstone project to address the challenges of limited dermatological access, self-diagnosis risks, and medication adherence, particularly in underserved regions.

## Features

### **1. AI Skin Condition Diagnosis**
- **How it works**: Users upload images of their skin lesions, and the app uses a **ResNet CNN model** hosted on AWS SageMaker to provide a preliminary diagnosis.
- **Skin conditions covered**: Eczema, acne, and other common conditions.
- **Benefits**: Early detection and improved access to dermatological insights.

### **2. Medication Management**
- **Search functionality**: 
  - Search by **Drug Identification Number (DIN)** or medication name.
  - Integrated with Health Canadaâ€™s medication database.
- **User tools**: Add, edit, delete, and set reminders for medications.
- **Notifications**: Receive cloud-based reminders to enhance adherence to treatment.

### **3. Skincare Recommendations**
- **Personalized product suggestions**: Based on skin type, condition, and user preferences.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to match user needs with product features.

### **4. Progress Tracking**
- **Health monitoring**: Users can log symptoms and view analytics to track treatment effectiveness.
- **Data insights**: Compare individual progress with community trends for motivational benchmarking.

### **5. Data Privacy & Security**
- Adherence to strict data protection regulations.
- AWS Cognito ensures secure user authentication and encrypted data storage.
